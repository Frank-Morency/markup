# markup

Just a simple markup calculator in terminal!

You enter the price you bought it and the output are:

-The price you paid

-The sale price based on the % you put in source code

-The sale price with 10% discount

-The sale price with 15% discount

All those value could be changed in the source code.

*** note that the precision is not of a big concern in this case, maybee some testing should be done!
